# About the project
This project aims to analyze the revenue metrics of three different games released by a gaming company in 2022. These games are coded as game_1, game_2, and game_3. The analysis covers the period from March to December 2022 and includes user behavior such as active players, churned players, and returning players (back to churn), as well as revenue patterns like increases due to in-game purchases and decreases due to churned users.

# The problem
Although three games were launched in 2022, game_1 and game_2 had only 10 users combined. This suggests that these games either lacked sufficient promotion or failed to attract user interest. As a result, it is deemed not feasible to invest in these games in future periods. Therefore, all further analysis and insights focus solely on game_3.

The data contained in the databases (games_paid_users.csv and games_payments.csv) were examined and processed in accordance with the defined objectives to enable the creation of relevant visualizations. These operations were carried out both in the Python environment (using Jupyter Notebook) and the SQL environment. The cleaned and structured data was then visualized using Tableau.

All CSV files used in the study, the Jupyter Notebook file, and the SQL script file have been shared on the GitHub repository, and the link to the created dashboard is provided below.
